test_batch1_wiring.py -- regression tests for the Batch 1 wiring fixes.

Each test here pins one behaviour that used to be silently wrong: data the
app already collected but never got into the exported document. They are
deliberately plain assertions over the module functions rather than UI
tests, because the bugs were all in the wiring, not the widgets.

Run from this directory:
